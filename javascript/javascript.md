# üìåIntroduction

JavaScript is one of the most commonly used languages. It was mainly designed to add interactivity to the web pages. It is primarily a client-side language, it runs on your computer within your browser.
Almost 95% of websited today are build using JavaScript, which also inlcudes big websites like Facebook and YouTube.

JavaScript is one of the three core languages used to develop websites. Whereas HTML and CSS give a website structure and style, JavaScript lets you add functionality and behaviors to your website, allowing your website‚Äôs users to interact with great user experience.

JavaScript code does not needs to be compiled, it is interpreted at run time, making it much more dynamic.

## History of JavaScript

 Netscape company came together with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies. Later, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Although Java & JavaScript both this languages seems to sound similar, but they are as much as different as the language Tamil & Telgu. Finally, in May 1995,first code of Javascript was released and it was named 'Mocha'. Later it got replaced with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'.
 

## What is ECMAScript ?

ECMA stands for European Computer Manufacturer's Association. It is an organization that creates standards for technologies.
Due to rapid growth in JavaScript, Netscape decided to submit it for standardization. After submitting they could not use the word 'Java' in it's name because it was owned by SunMicro System, hence it was officially named to ECMAScript. However, it is still mostly known as JavaScript.


## Why to Use ?

 When you visit a web page in your browser, you are running it's code i.e. the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This code runs inside an execution environment which is our browser tab. Consider this scenario like a factory which will take raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).
- Speed : Client-side JavaScript is very fast because it can immediately run on the client's browser.
- Rich User Interface : JavaScript makes the UI of web application's look and feel much better.
- Server Load : Since it runs on client's browser, it reduces load on the web server.
- Enhanced Interaction : JavaScript adds interactivty on static pages and makes them react to user input.
- Modification : JavaScript can modify the content of a web page dyanamically, it can also change the style, position, color of the elements on the web page.
- Validation : JavaScript is used to perform validation checks on the user inputs before they are sent to the server.
