## üìå Programming languages

The purpose of language is to communicate just like humans interact with others through various human languages, we also neend some programming languages to communicate with computer since it does not understand human language.

Programming languages are set of instructions used to perfrom some task and are written in specific language like C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.

_Below is the list of some of the famous Programming languages :_

1.  JavaScript
2.  Swift
3.  Python
4.  Ruby
5.  Java
6.  C
7.  C++
8.  C#
9.  Go
10. PHP
11. Kotlin

## üìå IP Address

- IP Address stands for **Internet Protocol** Address.

- It is a string of numbers seperated by period/colon (./:) which are used to identify a specific computer network.

- Every device that is connected to the internet is assigned with a unique IP Address.

- They are allocated by the **_Internet Assigned Numbers Authority_** (IANA).

Versions :

| IPv4                                                                       | IPv6                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is 32-bit address and can store 2^32 addresses (4 billion + addresses). | It is the most recent version of IP Address and follows 128-bit scheme. |
| Numbers in IPv4 are seperated by period.                                   | Numbers in IPv6 are seperated by period.                                |
| Example : 12.244.233.165                                                   | Example : 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:7879                       |

## **IPv4 Classes**:

| Class   | Range     | Application                |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| Class A | 0 - 127   | Reserved for Local system. |
| Class B | 128 - 191 | Used for Internet          |
| Class C | 192 - 223 | Local Network              |
| Class D | 224 - 239 | Not used/Reserved          |
| Class E | 240 - 255 | Not used                   |

> _‚ùó IP Address is like our **Building's address**. When someone wants to meet us they would need atleast our Building's address and it can take them till the gate of our building._

&nbsp;

## üìå Port Number

- Port numbers are usually the entry point to the application.
- Range of Port number: 0 - 65535

| Range         | Application                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0 - 1023      | Can not be used by application, this port is used only by system . |
| 1024 - 49150  | Used for running web application.                                  |
| 49151 - 65535 | They are open port and can be use by anyone.                       |

> _‚ùó Port number is like our **room number to our home**._

&nbsp;

## **Web Port**

Any web application running on server using ports - 80 & 443.

Port 80 is used by HTTP & 443 by HTTPS which provides secure connection.

## üìå Domain

- Domain name is basically what the users see on the browser's url bar.
- All computers are assigned a unique IP Address however it can be difficult to remember those everytime. Hence, domain names are used.
- Whenever user enters a domain name of a web page in the search bar, a request is sent to _**DNS**_ (Domain Name System) Server which in return looks up for the IP Address of that requested domain and makes that web page accessible to user. It is similar to giving directions of a particular address.
- Domain names are available in many different extensions. The most popular one is .com. There are many other options like .org, .net, .tv, .info, .io, etc.

  Some examples:

  | domain | Full-form                  |
  | ------ | -------------------------- |
  | .br    | Brazil                     |
  | .it    | Italy                      |
  | .pt    | Portugal                   |
  | .mx    | Mexico                     |
  | .cn    | China                      |
  | .ru    | Russia                     |
  | .in    | India                      |
  | .ca    | Canada                     |
  | .th    | Thailand                   |
  | .gov   | Government agencies        |
  | .edu   | Educational institutions   |
  | .org   | Organizations (non-profit) |
  | .mil   | Military                   |
  | .com   | commercial business        |
  | .net   | Network organizations      |

## Structure of a url:

    Example : https//www.domain-name.com

- https: Protocol
- www : Sub-domain
- domain-name : Domain-name
- .com : Top Level Domain
- domain-name.com : Root Domain

> _‚ùó If a website is considered as a house then the domain name is indicated as it's address_

## üìå Browsers

- Web browser is a software program which is primarily used for displaying and accessing websites on the internet.
- Web browsers work as part of a client/server model. The client is the browser which runs on the user‚Äôs device and makes requests to the Web server, while the server-side is the Web server which sends information back to the browser.
- The browser then interprets and displays the information on the user‚Äôs device.

  ## **Popular web browsers** :
